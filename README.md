# tla-bin

tla-bin is a wrapper around https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus that provides
command line binaries for pcal, tlc, tlatex and sany, making automation around
TLA+ easy.  Also provides a binary that starts the TLA+ REPL.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pmer/tla-bin.git
$ cd tla-bin
$ ./download_or_update_tla.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

The `download_or_update_tla.sh` script takes an optional `--nightly` argument.
If passed, it will download the nightly CI build of TLA+ rather than the latest
release.

The `install.sh` script takes an optional location argument.  By default,
binaries and the tla jar file are installed below `/usr/local`.

## Usage

Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.7E-19
6 states generated, 5 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 5.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 1 and the 95th percentile is 1).
